Currently we are building a backend which can be reached by other services/repos with a tRPC client.
If you are using another language than TS... then you might fulfill a PR and implement gRPC (are you sure u want pain?).

## Quickstart

Requirements:

- Bun installed
- A Postgres database
- An Azure App Registration

> [!NOTE]
> You can skip Azure by making `AZURE_*` env vars optional in `./src/env.ts`
> and by removing all Azure related auth in `./src/azure/`

1. Install packages
   ```sh
   bun install
   ```
2. Setup environment variables in `.env` (use `.env.example` as template and see `./src/env.ts` as source of truth)
3. Run the DB migration
   ```sh
   bun db:migrate
   ```
4. Run the server
   ```sh
   bun dev
   ```
